# DO NOT USE: This boilerplate is way out of date and won't be receiving any more updates!

## Redux Boilerplate

This is the boilerplate I use as a quick start for experiments with Redux. It is kept up to date with the latest releases of redux, react-redux, redux-devtools, react-router and redux-simple-router, including beta (and sometimes alpha) releases. As it using the latest and greatest (and potentially unstable) releases, it should not be used as boilerplate for production code.

### Usage

Install:
```
git clone https://github.com/ellbee/redux-boilerplate.git
cd redux-boilerplate
npm install
```

Run:
```
npm start
```

Run with devtools:
```
npm run devtools
```
