##Redux Boilerplate

This is the boilerplate I use as a quick start for experiments with Redux. It is kept up to date with the latest releases of redux, react-redux, redux-devtools, react-router and redux-router, including beta (and sometimes alpha) releases. As it using the latest and greatest (and potentially unstable) releases, it may not be suitable as boilerplate for production code.
